# Provisional Patent Write-Up (Draft)

**Title:** RadOnc DoseCheck â€“ Automated Verification of Radiotherapy Plan Constraints

**Background:** Manual checklisting of OAR dose constraints is error-prone and variable.

**Summary:** Software receives DVH metrics, compares them to stored thresholds, and outputs pass/caution/fail in real time. A configurable caution band and presets support different fractionations. Exports Markdown summaries (and can be extended to PDF).

**Claims (examples):**
1. Receiving OAR dose values, comparing with stored thresholds, and outputting pass/caution/fail.
2. Customizable constraint libraries and presets for fractionation types.
3. Import/export of DVH (CSV) and constraints (JSON).
4. Generation of a standardized report.

**Figures:** After running locally, capture screenshots of the table, summary chips, and demo values for inclusion.
